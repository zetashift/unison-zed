# unison-zed

[Unison](https://www.unison-lang.org/) support for [Zed](https://zed.dev/). The friendly programming language from the future with the futuristic editor.

## TODOs

- Improve tree-sitter syntax highlighting in `languages/highlights.scm`.

## Language server

Currently `nc` is hardcoded as the language server, so you'll need to have `nc` installed.

### Linux

For `apt` based distros:

```sh
sudo apt install netcat
```

### MacOS

`nc` comes bundled with Mac, no extra steps required!
